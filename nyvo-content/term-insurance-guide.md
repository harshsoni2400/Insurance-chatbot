# Complete Guide to Term Insurance in India

## What is Term Insurance?

Term insurance is pure life insurance that provides financial protection to your family in case of your untimely death during the policy term. It offers the highest coverage at the lowest premium compared to other life insurance products.

## Why Term Insurance is Important

### The Numbers
- If you earn ₹10 lakhs annually and your family depends on you
- Over 30 years, that's ₹3 crores your family would lose if something happens to you
- Term insurance ensures this income replacement at affordable premiums

### Who Needs Term Insurance?
- Primary breadwinners
- People with dependents (spouse, children, parents)
- Those with outstanding loans (home loan, car loan)
- Anyone with financial responsibilities

## How Term Insurance Works

1. **You pay premium**: Annual/monthly payment to insurer
2. **Coverage during term**: If death occurs during policy term, nominee receives sum assured
3. **Term ends**: If you survive the term, policy expires (no payout in pure term)
4. **Payout options**: Lump sum, monthly income, or combination

## Types of Term Insurance Plans

### 1. Pure Term Insurance (Level Term)
- Fixed sum assured throughout the term
- Lowest premium option
- No maturity benefit
- Best for: Maximum coverage at minimum cost

### 2. Term Insurance with Return of Premium (TROP)
- Get back all premiums if you survive the term
- Higher premium (30-40% more than pure term)
- Best for: Those who want "something back" if they survive

### 3. Increasing Cover Term Insurance
- Sum assured increases by fixed percentage annually (5-10%)
- Protects against inflation
- Best for: Young professionals expecting income growth

### 4. Decreasing Cover Term Insurance
- Sum assured decreases over time
- Ideal for covering decreasing liabilities (like home loans)
- Lower premium
- Best for: Covering specific loans/liabilities

### 5. Whole Life Term Insurance
- Coverage till age 99/100
- Higher premium than regular term
- Best for: Lifetime protection, wealth transfer

### 6. Group Term Insurance
- Provided by employers
- Usually low coverage (1-3x annual salary)
- Coverage ends with employment
- Best for: Supplementary coverage (not primary)

## How Much Coverage Do You Need?

### Human Life Value (HLV) Method
Calculate the present value of your future income:
- **Formula**: (Annual Income × Years until retirement) - Existing assets
- **Example**: ₹12 lakhs × 25 years = ₹3 crores

### Income Replacement Method
- **Rule of thumb**: 10-15 times annual income
- **Example**: ₹12 lakhs income → ₹1.2-1.8 crore coverage

### Expense Method
Add up:
1. Outstanding loans (home, car, personal)
2. Future expenses (children's education, marriage)
3. 10 years of household expenses
4. Emergency fund

### Practical Recommendations by Life Stage

| Life Stage | Recommended Coverage |
|------------|---------------------|
| Single, no dependents | 5-7x annual income |
| Married, no kids | 10x annual income |
| Married with kids | 15-20x annual income |
| Kids grown up, nearing retirement | 5-10x annual income |
