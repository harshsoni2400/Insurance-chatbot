- Term insurance (pure protection)
- Endowment plans (protection + savings)

In pure term insurance - nothing. Policy simply ends.

### Q: Can I increase my coverage later?
Some policies offer "life stage benefit" allowing coverage increase at milestones (marriage, child birth). Or you can buy additional policy.

### Q: What are riders in term insurance?
Add-on benefits you can attach to your base policy:
- Critical Illness Rider
- Accidental Death Benefit
- Waiver of Premium
- Terminal Illness Benefit

### Q: Do smokers pay more?
Yes, smokers typically pay 50-80% higher premiums due to increased health risks.
